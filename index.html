      <h1>Marie Blaise</h1>
      <h2>Founder @ DO IT ABROAD</h2>
      <p>I always wanted to live abroad. When I finished highschool, I moved to Australia and studied finance there for 4 years. After that I realised finance was not for me. I moved again and stayed a couple of months in Asia where I volunteered and worked with children. Then I came back to Europe to be closer to my family and did a Master degree in Innovation in Barcelona. After that I started working for a startup in Berlin but I thought life was too short to work for someone else. Working hard was always my thing so I tought I might as well do it for me instead of others so I came back home and launched a service I wished existed when I was a highschool student: a platform that finds the right degree for you worlwide and handles the application process. </p>

          <p>This is my favorite book because I think it is such a huge source of inspiration, motivation, this is basically the bible for me. When I struggle to achieve what I want to do, I take 15 minutes for my self and read this book. It is basically a compilation of very small chapter, 3 to 5 pages, relating the tips of high achiever more or less known people whether they are politicians, athelts or artists.</p></td>

          <p>This is my second favorite book :) But I have to admit that it comes ver close with the first one! This one is less about achievements than about self developement and knowing what you really like doing deep down. It is a bit about finding your life purpose. It is not a big book compared to The Tools of Titans! It tells you about how passion makes you overcome any challenge life throuws at you</p></td>

          <p>Most beautiful country I have ever visited. The landscape are beautful, the weather is amazing, the people are incredibly welcoming, you can swim in the sea all year, hold koalas, feed kangourous and live a crazy life without anyone judging because nobody cares</p></td>
